# ConvertEink
I Bought a Waveshare 7.3 inch 7-Color 800x480 Eink display and converting images was less than optimal, also, lightenting is easier
Bought HERE [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C4TS1NMS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1#customerReviews]

Using C# and GTKSharp

I also added the ability to "Lighten up" the picture as the display tends to be dim.

Tested on Linux

Go to Relases and download for Windows Linux or Mac
